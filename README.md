# eAnt

Old project, inactive since 26/12/2005.

Straight from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eant/), was used by tens of thousands users. Imported in GitHub for reference with a bit of nostalgy. Commit history not preserved.

The old description from the [project page on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eant/):

> eAnt is a P2P App written in C# (currently only for .NET Framework, but soon also for Mono) for files exchange. eAnt uses the same network used by eD2k/eMule clients. Inactive since 26/12/2005. Rest in peace eAnt.
